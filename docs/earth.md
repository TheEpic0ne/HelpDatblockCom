# War

## Sieging

As a king or general, place a coloured banner in the wilderness close to a town. This action will initiate a new siege, or cause the attacker to join an existing one. The upfront cost of the siege for the attacker is $500.

### Gaining siege points
As an attacker (soldier/general/king) or a defender (guard/sheriff/mayor), occupy the wilderness area close to the siege banner and/or kill enemy players within a large radius of the siege banner. Allies can contribute.

### Winning
Be the side with the best score when the siege victory timer hits zero. The attacker requires a positive points total to win. The defender requires a negative points total to win.

### Abandon attack
As a king or general, place an all-white banner near the siege-attack-banner.

### Surrender town
As a mayor, place an all-white banner anywhere in the town.

### Plunder town
As a king or general, after the siege is won, place a chest in the wilderness close to the town. This action will rob the town $500 per plot, transferring it to the plundering nation.

### Capturing town
As a king or general, after the siege is won, place a coloured banner in the wilderness close to the town. This action will forcibly add the town to the nation, and will put the town into an 'occupied' state, in which its residents cannot affect siege points. 

## Commands

View detailed information on any siege affecting the town, using `/t`.
View a list of any sieges the nation is involved in, using `/n`.
As a mayor, when a certain duration has passed after an invasion, typically many days, the town can revolt and be free of the occupying nation. This is done using `/n leave`.
As a king, if your nation gets deleted for any reason, including capture of your last town, you will be refunded 90% of the initial setup cost. This can be triggered voluntarily using `/n delete`.
As a mayor, declare your town to be neutral using `/t toggle neutral`. A neutral town cannot voluntarily join any nation and is immune to material siege costs (pvp, plunder, taxes). Attackers can still invade if they manage to defeat the town, but the occupation is in-name-only, with no material benefits provided (except to increase nation town count).

## Town neutrality

A neutral town is protected from siege-forced-pvp, plunder, and occupation taxes. The neutral town can be captured, adding to an invading nation's town count, but the occupation is in-name only.

As a mayor, declare your town to be neutral using `/t toggle neutral`. A neutral town cannot voluntarily join any nation
